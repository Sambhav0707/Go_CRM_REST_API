## 🚀 Features

- **Lead Management**: Create, read, and delete leads
- **RESTful API**: Clean API endpoints for all operations
- **SQLite Database**: Lightweight database for data persistence
- **GORM Integration**: Object-Relational Mapping for database operations
- **Fiber Framework**: Fast HTTP web framework for Go

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Core Dependencies
- **Go 1.24.5**: Programming language
- **Fiber v1.14.6**: Fast HTTP web framework inspired by Express.js
- **GORM v1.9.16**: Object-Relational Mapping library for Go
- **SQLite3**: Lightweight database engine

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24.5 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CRM_Golang
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

## 📚 API Endpoints

### Lead Management

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/lead` | Get all leads |
| GET | `/api/v1/lead/:id` | Get a specific lead by ID |
| POST | `/api/v1/lead` | Create a new lead |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/lead/:id` | Delete a lead by ID |

### Lead Model

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "company": "string", 
  "email": "string",
  "phone": "string"
}
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Create a Lead
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/lead \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "company": "Acme Corp",
    "email": "john@acme.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890"
  }'
```

### Get All Leads
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/lead
```

### Get Specific Lead
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/lead/1
```

### Delete Lead
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/v1/lead/1
```

## 🗄️ Database

The application uses SQLite3 as the database engine with GORM for ORM operations. The database file (`lead.db`) is automatically created when the application starts.

### Database Schema
- **Leads Table**: Stores lead information with auto-generated ID, timestamps, name, company, email, and phone

## 🔧 Development

### Project Structure Details

- **`main.go`**: Application entry point, database initialization, and route setup
- **`database/database.go`**: Database connection configuration
- **`lead/lead.go`**: Lead model definition and CRUD operations
- **`go.mod`**: Go module configuration and dependencies

### Key Components

1. **Database Connection**: SQLite3 database with GORM ORM
2. **Lead Model**: GORM model with JSON tags for API serialization
3. **REST API**: Fiber-based HTTP server with CRUD endpoints
4. **Auto-migration**: Database schema automatically created on startup
